                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>The Wildlife Rehabilitation Center is dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of injured and orphaned wildlife. Our team of trained professionals works tirelessly to provide medical care and support to animals in need, with the ultimate goal of returning them to their natural habitats.</p>
                <p>Founded in 2003, we have been serving our local community for 3 years, partnering with veterinarians, conservationists, and volunteers to make a positive impact on wildlife conservation.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to promote the well-being of wildlife and their habitats through education, rehabilitation, and advocacy. We believe that every animal deserves a chance to thrive, and we are committed to providing the care and resources necessary to make that possible.</p>
